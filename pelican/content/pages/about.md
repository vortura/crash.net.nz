Title: about

I'm Richard Gray, and I write here sometimes.

I like web ops and Unix, which is lucky because that's what I do for a living.
I also like to program, especially in [Python][1] and [Processing][2], and
sometimes in C.  I like [mathematics][3], and [photography][4], and [generative
art][5].  I think [IK+][6] is the greatest video game of all time.

This website is made with [Pelican][7], a Python-based static website generator.
The design is my own, but I've borrowed liberally from [Steve Losh][8], [Laurens
Van Houtven][9], and [Simon Hørup Eskildsen][10]. Thanks, guys.

You can also find me me on [Github][11] and [Twitter][12], and you can send me an
[email][13] if you like.
